# VideoSaliency
PyTorch implementation of a video saliency detection model.

## References
- For the encoder the [S3D](https://github.com/kylemin/S3D) network is used. Also the weights file for training the
encoder network comes from the same source.
- [TASED-Net](https://github.com/MichiganCOG/TASED-Net) was one of the main inspirations and some pieces of code
proposed by its authors has been used.
- [ViNet](https://github.com/samyak0210/ViNet) video saliency model was also used as the reference for the model structure.
- [DHF1K dataset](https://github.com/wenguanwang/DHF1K) was the main dataset used for training and comparisons between
mentioned models and the proposed one.
- [ACLNet PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/Nablax/ACLnet-Pytorch) is a more modern version of Wang's et. al.
ACLNet which was also referenced during the development.
